![Khalil (Small) (Custom)](https://github.com/adbkhalil9463/adbkhalil9463/assets/166882042/f9ef698c-a231-4512-9dbb-cb0eecf0b2f2)

The reason i'm here is to familiarize myself with Github, the programming development processes and systems, & to connect with like minded people that we can share knowledge, experience, ideas and collaborations.

I'm currently doing 2 courses on EdX - A Harvard Python Programming Course and A MIT Machine Learning with Python Course. My coding skills are elementary but getting better everyday and able to complete all the projects. I hope to grow to expert level with a focus on AI and robotics. Am still learning, researching and determining a specific app or software to work on creating. No rush, i want to up my skill and experience level plus build relationships with potential partners before committing to an major project/objective.

A little general knowledge and background about myself follow below:

I have a passion for Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Construction Project Management, Green Building, Renewable Resources Solutions, 3D Modelling, Augmented & Virtual Reality (AR/VR) Programming, AI, Machine Learning (AI/ML) & Robotics. 

Knowledgeable & experienced in large scale, high-end high-rise, foundation & complex Top-Down Structural & Geotechnical works. Technically gifted and a great problem solver. Superb communication and people management skills, able to help coordinate & motivate the project team whilst at the same time drive an efficient & productive construction process. A highly objective,rational, logical & analytical thinking. 

Am always looking to be part of an innovative, driven and united Project Team.

I'm dedicated to Life Long Learning, continuously pursuing education, constantly striving for Improvement & contributing positively to humanity.

I am concerned for our world & the future of humanity. We need to do better, be greener, engage in creative & innovative collaborations with each other politically, socially, economically & technically to provide a better future for the next generation. I will move heaven & earth to create a better earth and ecosystem for my son.

I enjoy working with my hands, building, modifying & repairing things. Hobbies are snooker, fishing and rock climbing but I haven't has much free time to do them. Need to make the time, would like to take up Go Karting too. Robot building with my son is a definite, hehe.

That's about it, I'll just add that I put much emphasis on communicating clearly and with upmost clarity. Decency, courtesy, compassion, empathy, modesty, respect and consideration in all our interactions with anyone no matter their age, standing or beliefs, is paramount.

 Khalil
